## The Problem

Most products today are **silent objects**.

* Once sold, products lose all connection to the brand.
* Physical goods remain disconnected, unverified, and forgotten after checkout.
* Brands rely on packaging and guesswork to build loyalty.
* The supply chain knows more about the product than the brand itself.
* In a world of AI and data, physical products offer zero insight into how they’re used or valued.
